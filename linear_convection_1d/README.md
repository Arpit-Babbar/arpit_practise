I would write the things that I feel would improve the code.

0) How was the code not showing an error when I wrote a[-1]
1) Use reference variables for initial data?
2) Don't put the PDE parameters in the main function, put them in the solver class.
3) Should the initial data and error be put in constructor or run_and_output_results? Putting in run_and_output_results helps us keep it in only when it's needed.

Is there a shortcut to changing all occurences of a function? I realized that I wish to change the order of inputs of the constructor. Can the editor do it?
