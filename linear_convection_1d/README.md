I would write the things that I feel would improve the code.

0) How was the code not showing an error when I wrote a[-1]
1) Use reference variables for initial data?
2) Don't put the PDE parameters in the main function, put them in the solver class.

Is there a shortcut to changing all occurences of a function? I realized that I wish to change the order of inputs of the constructor. Can the editor do it?
